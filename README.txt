= No Designing or Development Skills Required =
Not a tech savvy? ApplyOnline plugin is the solution. Its intuitive drag and drop form builder is made for you, so you may not need a developer and/or designer to create an Application Form Management System for you.

2. After activation, go to All Ads section in your WordPress admin panel and create your desired ads with drag and drop Application Form Builder.
3. To list ads on the front-end, create a dedicated WordPress page and write shortcode [aol]. isn't it so easy?

= Multiple Ad Types support with only one plugin =
Does your organization collect admission forms and also looking for job ads? Look no further, Ad Types feature is the solution for you. Go to *ApplyOnline/Settings/Types* in WordPress admin and create as many types as you wish. Just copy desired shortcode and paste into your WordPress page.

* Build a list of recipients to send email notifications when an application is received.
* Hooks and functions for advancements and customization.
